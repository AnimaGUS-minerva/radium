`radium` provides a helper trait with a uniform API for interacting with both
atomic types like [`AtomicUsize`], and non-atomic types like [`Cell<usize>`].

This crate is `#![no_std]`-compatible, and uses no non-core types.

For more details, see the trait's documentation.

[`AtomicUsize`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicUsize.html
[`Cell<usize>`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/cell/struct.Cell.html

## Target Architecture Compatibility

Not all Rust targets have symbols for atomic types! The compiler knows what
targets have what atomics, but does not expose this information on the stable
channel for libraries to use.

As such, `radium` uses a helper macro to detect the target architecture and emit
our own directives that mark the presence or absence of an atomic integer.

If `radium` does not work for your architecture, please update the `has_atomic!`
macro with your targetâ€™s correct listing of atomic instructions and submit a
pull request.
